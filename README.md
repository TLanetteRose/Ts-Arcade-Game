## Welcome and Background
It's been a long time since I've played **Frogger**. So, I was very curious about how I would do making my own version of Frogger. Luckily, most of the JavaScript files were provided. In this version, the player has to dodge racing roaches to cross the road. 

## How to Play
First load my game link to my game into your browser by clicking the following link: https://tlanetterose.github.io/Ts-Arcade-Game/

## Instructions
* After you have loaded the game into your browser, you will see the directions for the game on your screen. 
* Once you click the **Ready, Set, Go!** button, you're ready to start. 
* Goal-- You need to cross the road before you get run over or "poached" by a roach. If you collide with a roach, you start back at your beginning spot. You can use the up, down, left, or right arrows to move your player on the screen.
* You win when you make it safely to the water. Good luck!

## Dependencies

## How I Created My Game
I received the HTML, CSS, and JS files from my [Udacity] program. I then added my own CSS styling to the program. This project had three JS files: app (main JS), resources (JS for loading images), and engine (JS file with game loop). I added a modal to start the game and to replay at the end of the game.
