## Welcome and Background

It's been a long time since I've played **Frogger**. So, I was very curious about how I would do making my own version of Frogger. Luckily, most of the JavaScript files were provided for me:

## How to Play
First load my game link to my game into your browser: https://tlanetterose.github.io/Ts-Arcade-Game/

## Instructions
* After you have loaded the game into your browser, you will see the directions for the game on your screen. 
* Once you click the **Ready, Set, Go!** button, you're ready to start. 
* Goal-- You need to cross the road before you get run over or "poached" by a roach. If you collide with a roach, you start back at your beginning spot. You can use the up, down, left, or right arrows to move your player on the screen.
* You win when you make it safely to the water. Good luck!

## Dependencies

This game uses the following library(s):
* [Google Fonts](https://fonts.google.com/) : Open Sans was used for the body font and Luckiest Guy was used for the titles

## Installations 

There are no other installations for this game.

## How I Created My Game

I received the HTML, CSS, and JS files from my [Udacity] program. I then added my own CSS styling to the program. Since I am still learning JS, I did research other tutorials about making  memory programs. I learned that there are different formats for designing this game. 
One new skill I tried was adding elements and classes to the DOM using JS. However, I had difficulty getting my front and back images to work. So, I will keep working on that  project to share later. In this project, I used the unordered list in my HTML to set up my cards. My goal is to continue improving my JS skills so that I can program the game without tutorials.
