## Welcome and Background

Welcome to my first **Memory Game**. (Actually, it’s my third one, and the one that works.)  I want to say thank you to [] for her tutorial about designing a memory game. JavaScript is not my strongest area. Ms. Israel-Ovirih included guidelines for planning this project. My goal was to produce a memory game with a cover image and the group of matching images on the other side of the card. I’m still working on that version. This version uses the **Font Awesome**  icons and a special trick to keep them hidden…So, let’s talk about my project!

## How to Play
First load my game link to my game into your browser: https://tlanetterose.github.io/Ts-Arcade-Game/

## Instructions

It's been a long time since I've played **Frogger**. So, I was very curious about how I would do making my own version of Frogger. Luckily, most of the JavaScript files were provided for me: 
* app.js

## Dependencies

This game uses the following library(s):
* [Google Fonts](https://fonts.google.com/) : Open Sans was used for the body font and Luckiest Guy was used for the titles

## Installations 

There are no other installations for this game.

## How I Created My Game

I received the HTML, CSS, and JS files from my [Udacity] program. I then added my own CSS styling to the program. Since I am still learning JS, I did research other tutorials about making  memory programs. I learned that there are different formats for designing this game. 
One new skill I tried was adding elements and classes to the DOM using JS. However, I had difficulty getting my front and back images to work. So, I will keep working on that  project to share later. In this project, I used the unordered list in my HTML to set up my cards. My goal is to continue improving my JS skills so that I can program the game without tutorials.
